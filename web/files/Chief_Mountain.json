    "description": "A large, flat-topped mountain stands tall against a clear blue sky. The mountain is covered in a rugged, gray and brown rock, and its top is capped with a small patch of snow. In the foreground, the ground is covered in a carpet of bright yellow autumn leaves. A few trees stand out against the yellow, and a small forest of dark green trees stretches across the middle distance. The scene is one of impressive natural beauty, with the mountain dominating the landscape. The vivid colors of the leaves provide a striking contrast to the gray and brown of the mountain.",
