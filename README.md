# The classic YeAPF2/web example

This is a classic example in the sense that the data is sent to the server, processed and returned to the client with redirection capabilities.

It is a good starting point for those searching a well known space while researching what can be done differently in YeAPF2

### What do you need?

1. If you're using Windows, install `github bash` or any other bash of your preference. This is not mandatory, but a free suggestion (Free as in "no cost" and in "freedom")
2. `git` for pull the project. But you can download the `.zip` version
3. `composer` for pull and update the php components
4. `docker` to run the containers
5. `vscodium` or other editor of your choice.

It's outside the scope of this README to explain how to install and keep update those tools.

## How to install and use

1. clone this project in any folder
2. use composer to install/update the php components you'll need
3. open your browser and test
